    "## Q1 - \n",
    "For this assignment I wanted to do a sentiment analysis on the recent inaugural address by President Joe Biden. I found his speech on the White House website and input it into a csv file for easy access. I first imported the data into a dataframe, and began to count vectorize the tokens in the overall corpus. I wanted to understand what words I should look out for while trying to clean the text. Next I lemmatized the text. I chose to lemmatize because I knew that it would keep the text as true to natural words as possible, seeing that this is a speech, I wanted to maintain the text closest to the original format. To run this lemmatization I performed it based on the ‘verbs’ as its part of speech. Presidential addresses tend to be about action, so using verbs felt the most appropriate. The results of this process were mostly as expected, and I believe using ‘verbs’ was the correct choice. It tended to correct the tense of the verbs used, from ‘spoke’ to ‘speak’, for example. However, I did find it interesting that the algorithm liked to replace the word ‘is’ and ‘been’ with the word ‘be’. I can understand the idea behind present tensing ‘been’ but the word ‘is’ seemed straight forward enough, that I was surprised to see it changed. After the text was lemmatized, I count vectorized it again to see what words were left over. \n",
    "\n",
    "From analyzing the token counts of the lemmatized text, I could see there were a few ‘mishaps’ were made that I wanted to manually clean. The lemmatized didn’t seem to pick up on many plurals, so I combined them, such as ‘Americans’, ‘days’, and ‘centuries’, for example, with their singular versions. I also replaced a couple of ‘ha’ that had been cut from ‘has’. After this cleaning I applied it to the dataframe and got ready for the sentiment analysis."

    "## Q2 -\n",
    "For the sentiment analysis, I decided to go with the HL dictionary. I felt that since it had a larger dictionary to work from, it could handle a bit more in its determination. While researching these dictionaries, I liked that the HL groups came from multiple sources of language, not just tweets, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then applied the HL analysis to all three of my text groups: original, lemmatized, and cleaned. The results were mostly as expected. I was however expecting a heavier presence of positive sentiment, but most of what was analyzed came back as neutral. However, positive did win over negative each time. The President’s speech came off a very dark year in our country, but I remember him putting a lot of emphasis on the good days to come. So it was nice to see that the analyzer picked up on more positives than negatives. It was interesting to see that in one line, the president thanks his predecessors for their presence at the event. Both the original and lemmatized text found this positive, yet the clean text found it neutral. And another interesting assessment found that the original and lemmatized texts found the single word line of “unity.” to be neutral, yet when the clean text uses lower case “unity.” It is found as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not think that one type of text provided a more accurate portrayal of the sentiment than the other. There were not many differences between the three analysis. Less than 10 lines switched from one group to the next. I do think that if I could make any changes, seeing as all three were most dominated by neutral sentiment, that I would make each document a combination of a few lines, I would want to give the algorithm more text to make its decision on. I think the source may have broken up the lines just enough that they ended up mostly being neutral, whereas the previous or next line could make a large impression on the overall sentiment when read in context."
