    "# Question 1 - \n",
    "For this assignment, I will be working for a fictional music news and media company. Something similar to the likes of Guitar World, a magazine and online publishing company. The data that is collected is surrounding the topic of new gear coming out in the music industry. Every year, there is the NAMM show, the world’s largest trade show for manufacturers and dealers that work in the music industry. Unfortunately this year, there was no floor show, due to the pandemic, so many companies took to the web for a virtual show of sorts. I scraped both a world renowned music retailer for new product listings, as well as Twitter, to assess the social media activity surrounding the virtual show. The idea was to collect data about new gear, names, pricing, etc. as well as to try and keep up with what the buzz is surrounding the event, that way our management can stay on top of trends and make informed decisions on how to direct the staff writers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the retailer, Andertons Music Co, I made a scrape of their new NAMM 2021 guitars page. I was able to collect text on the name of each item. This could easily provide us with the ability to monitor which brands are featured the most and which are more active, as well as providing us streamlined information about each product such as model and color. For non-text information, I was also able to compile pricing, URLs, instrument category, and the date the scrape was made. All of this will be very helpful to supply our management team with ways that they can see what kinds of guitars, what player level they target based on price, and where to find the listings, very quickly. For the Twitter scrape, I collected original tweets around #BelieveinMusic. The text collected would be the tweets themselves, allowing the managers to keep tabs on the what the industry is currently buzzing about. For non-text elements I also scraped retweet and favorite counts, date crated, user names, descriptions, followers, and location, and finally applied a category of “Tweet” to help in cases where more social media sites are scraped in the future, and we want ways to organize them. I believe this non-text material will greatly help managers decipher who has influence and what to follow, giving them access to the virality of certain topics as well as what parts of the globe are following what trends. All of this information combined will allow our management teams decide what to write about and the useful information to include for our readers."

    "# Question 2 -\n",
    "The data gathered was very different from each other. Both coming from different sources and looking for different kinds of data. I wanted them to come from different types of sources to provide the company with a broader sense of information to write from. One source comes from a retail site, providing more tabular, retail information, the other comes from social media, which has a lot less structure to the text, but helps us understand what’s currently important to report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of this data required different tools. One comes from the BeautifulSoup package, designed to make a request and pull the information from the HTML code. This required some more accurate navigation of the site code to find where each bit of information I needed was stored, before applying those collections into a data frame. On the other hand, for Twitter I had to use the developer API to collect the information surrounding each tweet. This process was more about choosing what I did and did not want to collect on each tweet and store in my data frame. However I did have to do some research into filtering the pulls down to just original tweets, I wanted to avoid dealing with duplicate information from different users, just because they were retweeting each other. Once that process was built, changing hashtags and gathering original tweets is repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data comes from two very different sources, it makes the data even more useful to the company. Since we now have a good look at both a retail and a social media perspective, we have the ability to follow trends and provide accurate purchasing information that our customers want to see at their fingertips. Technically speaking, this collection process can easily be modified to collect different batches of information. We can chose various other retail sites with relative ease, as well as being able to quickly adjust the hashtags we want to pull from twitter, if our social media teams are finding better topics to track. All of this makes for a robust and endlessly usable mining operation. Our media company can collect great data that I believe will help our writer’s give the readers what they really want to see."
